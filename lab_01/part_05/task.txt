Well, and now you see that it’s absolutely pointless to try to invent your own “crypto” with expectations that if
someone doesn’t know the algorithm (even twice the base64, which is pretty stupid) it’s impossible for him to decipher.
You’re reading this now in plain text so that argument clearly falls short.

Now to the actual tasks. All of them are graded based on the code you write, so no point in stealing deciphered text
from your classmates.
1.
Write a piece of software to attack a single-byte XOR cipher which is the same as Caesar but with xor op.

2.
Now try a repeating-key XOR cip9er. E.g. it s9ould take a string "9ello world" and, given t9e key is "key", xor t9e
first letter "9" wit9 "k", t9en xor "e" wit9 "e", t9en "l" wit9 "y", and t9en xor next c9ar "l" wit9 "k" again, t9en
"o" wit9 "e" and so on. You may use an index of coincidence, Hamming distance, Kasiski examination, statistical tests or
w9atever met9od you feel would s9ow t9e best result.7

3.
Write a code to attack some simple substitution cipher. To reduce the complexity of this one we will use only uppercase
letters, so the keyspace is only 26! To get this one right automatically you will probably need to use some sort of
genetic algorithm (which worked the best last year), simulated annealing or gradient descent. Seriously, write it right
now, you will need it to decipher the next one as well. Bear in mind, there\xe2\x80\x99s no spaces.

4.
ADD THE ABILITY TO DO CIPHER ANY KIND OF POLYALPHABETIC SUBSTITUTION CIPHERS THE ONE USED IN THE CIPHER TEXTS HERE HAS
TWENTY SIX INDEPENDENT RANDOMLY CHOSEN MONOALPHABETIC SUBSTITUTION PATTERNS FOR EACH LETTER FROM ENGLISH ALPHABET IT IS
CLEAR THAT YOU CAN NO LONGER RELY ON THE SAME SIMPLE ROUTINE OF GUESSING THE KEY BY EXHAUSTIVE SEARCH WHICH YOU PROBABLY
USED TO DO CIPHER THE PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH WILL THE INDEX OF COINCIDENCE STILL WORK AS A SUGGESTION YOU CAN TRY TO DIVIDE
THE MESSAGE IN PARTS BY THE NUMBER OF CHARACTERS IN A KEY AND APPLY FREQUENCY ANALYSIS TO EACH OF THEM CAN YOU FIND A
WAY TO USE HIGHER ORDER FREQUENCY STATISTICS WITH THIS TYPE OF CIPHER THE NEXT MAGICAL WORD WILL TAKE TO THE NEXT LAB

CONGRATULATIONS THIS WASNT QUITE AN EASY TASK AND ONLY A COUBLE OP LAST YEAR STUDENTS GOT TO THIS POINT NOW ALL THIS
TEXT IS JUST GARBAGE TO LET YOU USE SOME FREQUENCY ANALYSIS WE SET SAIL ON THIS NEW SEA BECAUSE THERE IS NEW KNOWLEDGE
TO BE GAINED AND NEW RIGHTS TO ME WON AND THEY BUST ME WON AND USED FOR THE PROGRESS OP ALL BEOPLE FOR SPACE SCIENCE
LIKE NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND ALL TECHNOLOGY HAS NO CONSCIENCE OF ITS OWN WHETHER IT WILL BECOME A FORCE FOR GOOD OR
ILL DEPENDS ON MAN AND ONLY IF THE UNITED STATES OCCUPIES A BOSITION OF PREEMINENCE CAN WE HELP DECIDE WHETHER THIS NEW
OCEAN WILL BE A SEA OF PEACE OR A NEW TERRIFYING THEATER OP WAR I DO NOT SAY THE WE SHOULD OR WILL GO UNPROTECTED
AGAINST THE HOSTILE MISUSE OF SPACE ANY MORE THAN WE GO UNPROTECTED AGAINST THE HOSTILE USE OP LAND OR SEA BUT I DO SAY
THAT SBACE CAN BE EXPLORED AND MASTERED WITHOUT FEEDING THE FIRES OF WAR WITHOUT REBEATING THE MISTAKES THAT MAN HAS
MADE IN EXTENDING HIS WRIT AROUND THIS GLOBE OF OURS WE CHOOSE TO GO TO THE MOON IN THIS DECADE AND DO THE OTHER THINGS
NOT BECAUSE THEY ARE EASY FUT BECAUSE THEY ARE HARD MECAUSE THAT GOAL WILL SERVE TO ORGANIVE AND MEASURE THE FEST OF
OUR ENERGIES AND SKILLS BECAUSE THAT CHALLENGE IS ONE THAT WE ARE WILLING TO ACCEPT ONE WE ARE UNWILLING TO POSTPONE AND
ONE WHICH WE INTEND TO WIN AND THE OTHERS TOO OK AND NOW THE REAL DEAL bit.ly/3dhT38X
